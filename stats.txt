Statistics today 
3 parts
1)	Basic statistics 
2)	Graphs
3)	Visulaization
Probabiity
Sample theorems

Around 10 days ======== 
Buffer time to learn python more

1)	You need to practice python
2)	You need to study the statistics


Statistics ========= very must in order to understand the data

What is statistics?
1)	Mathematics
2)	Probability
3)	Data
4)	Facts and figures
5)	Mean-mode-median
6)	Graphs
7)	Ratio

A Data

Virat Kohli average in ODI is 60

I asked to Rashad , is that True?

What Rashad will do
1)	Collect the data
2)	Organize the data
3)	Analyse the data
4)	Interpretation in graphical view


Data:
How many types of data available
String
Int
Float

English  =========== Math
RS AGARWAL
Quantitative and qualitative 
HC verma



1)	Numerical data  ============= Maths
    Quantitative data

2)	Categorical data ============ English
    Qualitative data 



Again numerical data divided into two parts

Maths

My salary : 50000
My salary: 60,500.495rs


A)	Continues data:
What is the temp:  30.5
98.4F ======= > fever  102 
Room tem: <>
B)	Discrete data:
How many houses you have : 1 or 2
How many fiends you have: 10 or 20

How many kids you have  ?  1,2,3
1.5  2.5



	
Numerical data (number representation)	Categorical data ( English)
Quantitative data	Qualitative data
Continues data	
Discrete data	

Levels of data:

Numerical data ======= ML/DL/NLP ====== AI 

Yes ===========1

1)	Nominal data
•	Categorical type
•	Name of the person
•	Name of the city
•	Hyd blr Chennai
•	Very very base level

2)	Ordinal data
•	Categorical type
•	But it maintains some order
•	Flop   Average  Hit   superhit  blockbuster
•	Primary  secondary  teritairy
•	High ---- Medium --- low
•	First  class  ---- second class --- third class

3)	Interval data
•	Numerical type of data
•	Extract equal intervals will be there
•	It does not have a zero scale
•	Temperature is the best example for interval level of data

4)	Ratio level data
                    The temperatures is in hyderbad twice as benguluru 
                      Temp(hyd) = 2*Temp(blr)
                     Temp in hyd  50c
                      Temp in blr =25c
                     Is this True
Units?
50c= 2*25c ==================== 
Temp(hyd) in F = 2* Temp(Blr)F
50 in C ========== > 122F
25 in C ========== > 77F
122= 2*77


Weight :  60kgs
Kid = 3okgs
60=2*30kgs

If it is has zero scale =========== > Ratio level of data
If it does not have zero scale ===== > Interval data

Open intro statistics

Probality 


Two types of statistics

1)	Descriptive statistics
2)	Inferential statistics

Population                                Sample

In India every person if you consider  140cr ======== Population
If you select only 1lakh =================== > sample

Population means collection of every object
Sample means selection of some objects from corresponding population





Election fever:
1)	Mobin
2)	Karthik
3)	Rashadh
4)	Jyostns
Which party will win?

Sample data ======== instead of population
What is the reason?
1)	Population is huge
2)	Time complexity
3)	Cost 

My team researched and they are conclude

Sir based on our analysis in Telangana =============== 
Will analyse on sample ======= will estimate the analysis on population

25 yaers -40 salary ========= avg
Estimate ========== infer

Inferential statistics:
Will work on samples , will estimate the outcome on population

Descriptive statistics:
Will work on population , will estimate outcome on population

99.99% ======== 100% 

What ever you worked sample

You are estimating ======= mean 
                                 ======== median
                            ======== mode


Here mean is a statistic
           Median is a statistic


You are working on sample to identify a mean ======= estimated mean of population
Here mean: statistic
Inferential statistics:  statistic can be mean/median/mode

You are working on population ========= estimating outcome on population
Outcome: Parameter
Descriptive statistics: Parameter can be mean/median/mode


1)	Linear regression
2)	Logistic regression
3)	Decision tree
4)	KNN
5)	Naïve bayes
6)	SVM
7)	RF
8)	Bagging/boosting
9)	K-mean
10)	Hireactchical
11)	Density based 
5 qns ======== kid
5 qns
6qns ==============

Sir just give a little difference between statistic (mean/median/mode) :  inferential statistics
 and parameters can mean/median/mode  : descriptive statistics
when will a mean will be statistic
when will a mean will be statistic?
If you work on sample ========== estimating population
When will be a mean parameter?
If you work on population ========= estimation population
