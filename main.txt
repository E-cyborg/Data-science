these are the main topics to learn machine learning 

day 1:
    Today in my data science class, I learned what data science is, how it works, and the key requirements. Data science involves taking historical data, feeding it into machine learning algorithms, and using that to predict future outcomes. To become a data scientist or ML engineer, I need to focus on Python, SQL, and math.
    Tomorrow’s goal:
        Watch the next video
        Apply to 10-20 internships
        Post 2-3 updates on LinkedIn
day 2:
    Today, I revisited the concept of what data science is. The instructor also showed us examples of what can be achieved using data science.
    Key areas to focus on:
    Machine Learning (ML)
    Deep Learning
    Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    Tomorrow’s goal:
        Watch the next video                - done
        start leet code                     - 
        start opencv                        -
        internships                         - done
day 3:
    today, the instructor show ml types and there algo

        2). 1-2 leetcode problems        - >
        3). opencv
        4). new python Libraries
        5). college work

day 4:
    TODAY  class was about the ide's 
    and math is important  
        cosine similarity
    
    today there was alot of word so i was able to only complete the video.
    Tomorrow’s goal:
        next video,
        finish the remaining tasks

day 5: 
    toady on ds i havve watched 2 video and the instructor show about annaconda and some basic python
    now going for leetcode
    
    Tomorrow’s goal:
        next video 
        complete the taks
