these are the main topics to learn machine learning 

day 1:
    Today in my data science class, I learned what data science is, how it works, and the key requirements. 
    Data science involves taking historical data, feeding it into machine learning algorithms, and using that to predict future outcomes. 
    To become a data scientist or ML engineer, I need to focus on Python, SQL, and math.
    Tomorrow’s goal:
        Watch the next video
        Apply to 10-20 internships
        Post 2-3 updates on LinkedIn
day 2:
    Today, I revisited the concept of what data science is. The instructor also showed us examples of what can be achieved using data science.
    Key areas to focus on:
    Machine Learning (ML)
    Deep Learning
    Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    Tomorrow’s goal:
        Watch the next video                - done
        start leet code                     - 
        start opencv                        -
        internships                         - done

    going for video     just basic python
    going for opencv

day 9:
    today i was not on the mood to do work but i did some 
    opencv , ds and 1 internship assignment
    ds : was about the basic of python if else , try execpt blocks 
            keyworks and errors
    till 3rd nov :- Course date 
    going for leet code 

day 10:
    this day i watched WALL-E movie it was good but dangerous at the same time

day 11:
    skiped the known content of python

day 12:
    i skiped tow days ,this is not good , will reecover it 
    today left of statistics portation 
    27th nov
    my RAM is full i can't open anything on this laptopwithout opening anything its using 70-80% of ram 
    and the ram price is increasing so fast 
    can't buy it 
    toady was not good not bad 
    Tomorrow’s goal 
        leetcode
        next video
        10 -internship, 10- competition, hackathons

    inferential statistics and descriptive statistics     : - Descriptive statistics summarize and describe features of a dataset (like mean, median, charts), focusing only on the data you have, while inferential statistics use sample data to make predictions, generalizations, or hypotheses about a larger population (using tests like t-tests, regression), going beyond the immediate data to draw broader conclusions
    population and sample statistics                      : - a population is the entire group you want to study (e.g., all cars in a factory), while a sample is a smaller, manageable subset of that population (e.g., 100 cars chosen for testing) used to make inferences about the whole group because studying the entire population is often impractical
